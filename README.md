# cssrandomizer
randomize html &lt;p> tags to create random and strange form responses.

This program uses c# for osx I recomend mon develop for windows .net

There is a fair amount of explination once the program is running so I will be brief here.

please note your gen flags must be typed properly for the program to run and your input must be
one line on html code. It is possible to do multiple html elements like so: &lt;p>hi&lt;/p>&lt;p>hi again&lt;/p.

Enjoy.
